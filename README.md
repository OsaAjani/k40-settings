# Settings for K40 CO2 laser cutting

This is settings for nice clean cutting of various materials with my K40 machine.

My K40 have been modified to use a 50W laser. You may need to tweak a little to adjust to the normal 40W laser.

Each material have his own **.md** file, with settings for various thickness inside the file.

The dir test-templates contain various testing templates to help determine correct settings for one material.
