# Settings for birch plywood

### Thickness: 3mm
| Operation | Power mA / % |Â Speed mm/s | Number pass |
|-|-|-|-|
| Raster Engrave | 5ma / - | 100 | 1 |
| Vector Engrave | 5ma / - | 100 | 1 |
| Vector Cut     | 7-8ma / - | 5  | 1 |

Notes:
    I'm not happy with engraving. It vaporize very deep with quite a low contrast. What I'm aiming for is mostly surface marking with high contrast and almost no material removing. But for now I don't know how to achieve that as under 5ma the laser simply start not shooting.
